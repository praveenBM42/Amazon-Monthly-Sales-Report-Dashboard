# Amazon-Monthly-Sales-Report-Dashboard
The Amazon Monthly Sales Report Dashboard in Power BI provides an interactive, visual summary of Amazon's sales data for a specific month. Designed to support data-driven decision-making, the dashboard allows users to easily explore and analyze key performance metrics, such as total revenue, profit margins, product sales trends, and regional performance.

By consolidating data into a single, user-friendly interface, this dashboard enables Amazon sellers, analysts, or business managers to gain insights into customer purchasing behaviors, identify best-selling products, and pinpoint high-performing regions. Users can filter data by various dimensions (such as product category, region, or date) to get a clear, detailed view of their monthly sales performance.

This project is especially useful for e-commerce stakeholders who aim to enhance their understanding of sales dynamics and maximize profitability. The report can be regularly updated to track performance over time, providing valuable information to make strategic decisions for future growth.
